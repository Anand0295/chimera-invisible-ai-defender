# Chimera Invisible AI Defender

⚠️ **EXPERIMENTAL USE ONLY - LAB ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH PROJECT** ⚠️

## Overview

The Chimera Invisible AI Defender is a research simulation project designed for controlled cybersecurity analysis in isolated laboratory environments. This system demonstrates advanced defensive techniques using AI-driven threat detection and response mechanisms.

**CRITICAL DISCLAIMER**: This project is intended SOLELY for educational research, security analysis, and controlled testing in isolated environments. All counterattack and active defense capabilities are DISABLED by default and should NEVER be enabled in production environments.

## Module List

1. **Stealth Loader** (`stealth_loader/`) - Kernel-level persistence simulation
2. **AI Firewall Engine** (`firewall_engine/`) - Dynamic rule adjustment using RL
3. **Behavior Monitor** (`behavior_monitor/`) - Process and file integrity monitoring
4. **Network Forensics** (`network_forensics/`) - Packet analysis and traceback
5. **DDoS Simulator** (`ddos_simulator/`) - Controlled attack simulation
6. **Control Channel** (`control_channel/`) - Encrypted inter-module communication

## Safety Features

- All modules include simulation-only modes
- No real network attacks or counterattacks
- Comprehensive logging and audit trails
- Isolated execution environments required
- Explicit consent mechanisms for all operations

## Build Requirements

- Rust 1.70+
- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch 2.0+
- libpcap (for network analysis)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone <repository-url>
cd chimera-invisible-ai-defender
cargo build --release
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing

All modules include comprehensive test suites:

```bash
cargo test --all
python -m pytest tests/
```

## Ethical Guidelines

This project adheres to responsible disclosure principles and ethical security research standards. Users must:

1. Only deploy in isolated, controlled environments
2. Obtain explicit authorization before any testing
3. Disable all active defense mechanisms in production
4. Report findings through appropriate channels
5. Respect applicable laws and regulations
